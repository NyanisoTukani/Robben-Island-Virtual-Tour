, I created a Virtual Reality (VR) experience for exploring Robben Island, including Nelson Mandela's cell. This immersive VR environment also features an interactive recreation of Govan Mbeki's cell. The experience includes a screen displaying videos about the apartheid struggle and allows users to interact by grabbing objects within the VR setting. I used Unity3D for developing the VR experience and programmed it using C#.
